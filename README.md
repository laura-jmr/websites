# y2k-websiteðŸŒ·
As a widely liked modern art and design style, y2k also has my personal interest. Out of this interest I wanted to create a website based on this style, 
so the main focus in this website project is **design**.

As a fullstack developer, I want to showcase my three main web developement working fields as a frontend developer, backend developer and a designer (by heart<3).
I have been struggeling to decide wether to study computer science or design and thought about restarting my studying carrer in a design course many times.
I took my time to find my personal path in the fields of computer science and take a step back from black and white thinking about creativity and logic. 
So at some point I found myself working in webdevelopement and I was very happy to feel joy in the whole process of developing a webapplication, from the design to the frontend, to funcionalities and the backend.
